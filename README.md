### Features
- Add recipes! :)
- Look at recipes! :D
- Edit recipes! :DD
- Serving size adjustment! :DDD
- Remove recipes :(
- View metric recipes in imperial units and vice-versa
- Import and export recipe files
- Generate shopping lists
- Keep track of recipes with tags
- Set default unit systems, serving sizes, language, and recipe (see
  [the section on configuration](#configuring-herms-and-managing-recipe-files))

#### What's new:

See [the changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for migration support and more detailed discussion.

- Herm's supports YAML! Recipe files are now stored in YAML format by default
  (the old format is deprecated, see [the changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)).
  Furthermore, recipes can be imported and exported in JSON and YAML formats.
- *Breaking change*: Units now have a different internal representation.
  Recipes written for old versions of Herm's will have to be converted (see
  [#71](https://github.com/JackKiefer/herms/pull/71) to see how the example
  recipes were changed). More breaking changes are expected as Herm's begins to
  use YAML as its representation format (see
  [#37](https://github.com/JackKiefer/herms/issues/37)).
- Herm's now conforms to the [XDG Base Directory
  Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).
  In short, `config.hs` and `recipes.herms` are now stored in `~/.config/herms`
  and `~/.local/share/herms` respectively on most Linux systems.
- Hola! Herm's now has language support for Español (Spanish)! Check out the rest of our supported languages in
  our [supported languages section](#supported-languages). Set your language preferences in ``config.hs``!
  These are  but the first languages that Herm's is now capable of supporting. We need your help to
  translate it into others!

#### Supported languages
- English
- Español (Spanish)
- Français (French)
- Pirate
- Portuguese

### Contributing

Herms is very actively maintained and welcomes new contributions, whether in
code, issues, documentation, translations, or feature suggestions!

Please see [Contributing.md](./Contributing.md) for more information.

### Installation

At the moment, Herm's can only be installed via [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) or [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), but standalone binaries are in the works!

If you're interested developing/hacking Herm's instead of just using it, see [Contributing.md](Contibuting.md) instead.

##### Via Stack _(recommended)_

```
stack update
stack install herms
```

##### Manually cloning and installing from source with Stack

```
git clone https://github.com/JackKiefer/herms
cd herms
stack update
stack install
```

##### Via Hackage and Cabal

_Note_: Your mileage may vary with dependency resolution

```
cabal update
cabal install herms
```

##### Manually with Cabal

```
git clone https://github.com/JackKiefer/herms
cd herms
cabal update
cabal install
```

##### Manually with Nix

See [./nix/README.md](./nix/README.md).

### Usage

#### Command-line interface

Herm's has a pretty intuitive interface for users familiar with other command-line programs!

Below is the exhaustive list of all commands and their functionalities. Take a gander!

```
Usage:

        herms list [-g|--group] [--tags TAGS]           list recipes
                   [--name-only ]

        herms add                                       add a new recipe (interactively)

        herms edit RECIPE_NAME                          edit a recipe

        herms import FILE_NAME                          import a recipe file

        herms export DESTINATION                        export recipes to DESTINATION

        herms remove RECIPE_NAMES                       remove the particular recipes

        herms view RECIPE_NAMES [-s|--serving INT]      view the particular recipes
                                [-t|--step]
                                [-c|--convert CONV_UNIT]

        herms shopping RECIPE_NAMES [-s|--serving INT] generate shopping list for particular recipes

        herms datadir                                  show locations of recipe and config files

Available options:

        -h|--help                                      Show this help text

        -v|--version                                   Show version

        RECIPE_NAME                                    index or Recipe name

        --sort SORT_ORDER                              'tags' to sort by tags

        -s|--serving INT                               specify serving size when viewing.
                                                       E.g., 'herms view -s 2 {recipe}' for two servings

        -t|--step                                      View recipe in "one-step-at-a-time" mode
                                                       (press enter between each direction)

        -g|--group                                     group recipes by tags

        --tags TAGS                                    show recipes with particular flags

        --name-only                                    only list recipes by name

        -c|--convert CONV_UNIT                         view the recipe converted to imperial or metric
                                                       E.g., 'herms view 2 -c imperial'
```

#### Configuring Herm's and managing recipe files

Herm's stores files in the following locations:

- The configuration file, `config.hs` in the XDG configuration directory,
  typically `~/.config/herms` on most Linux systems

- The recipes file, `recipes.herms` in the XDG data directory,
  typically `~/.local/share/herms` on most Linux systems

To see where these are stored on your system, run ``herms datadir``.

``config.hs`` is a pseudo-Haskell-source-code file with several options for configuring the behaviour of Herm's. It currently supports the following options:

- `defaultUnit` : The default unit system to show recipes in. Options: `Imperial`, `Metric`, `None`. Setting to `None` will simply show recipes in whatever unit system they're stored in.
- `defaultServingSize` : Default serving size to calculate when showing recipes. Can be any non-negative integer; set to `0` for no default. This can be useful when you're always cooking for the same number of people!
- `recipesFile` : The recipes file to use. This option currently supports relative (but not absolute) location, as well; if your data directory is `~/herms/data`, for example, and you want a recipe file in your home directory called `~/GrandmasHugeCookbook.herms`, set this option to `"../../GrandmasHugeCookbook.herms"`.
- `language` : Human language to use. Currently supported: ``"Français"``, ``"English"``, ``"Pirate"``
